# GLPI and OCS Inventory Docker Compose Project

This project sets up a complete environment for GLPI and OCS Inventory using Docker Compose, with both services running on HTTPS. The setup consists of MySQL, GLPI, and OCS services.

## Prerequisites

- Docker (version 20.10 or later)
- Docker Compose (version 1.29 or later)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. In the project directory, locate the `secrets.env` file. This file contains the environment variables required for setting up the MySQL, GLPI, and OCS services, such as database names, users, and passwords. Modify the values in `secrets.env` according to your requirements.
3. Ensure that the SSL certificate files `ssl.crt` and `ssl.key` are present in the `ssl/` directory. If they are missing, the `setup.sh` script will generate self-signed SSL certificates using OpenSSL. You can also provide your own SSL certificates by placing them in the `ssl/` directory before running the script.
4. Run the `setup.sh` script to build and start the Docker containers:

   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

The script will replace the placeholders in the sql/initdb.sql.template file with the values from secrets.env and create the final SQL file sql/initdb.sql. It will then build and start the Docker containers using Docker Compose.

## Accessing the Services

Once the containers are up and running, you can access the GLPI and OCS Inventory web interfaces using the following URLs:
- GLPI: https://localhost/glpi
- OCS Inventory: https://localhost:8443/ocsreports

The default credentials for GLPI and OCS Inventory are:

- GLPI:
    - Username: glpi
    - Password: glpi
- OCS Inventory:
    - Username: admin
    - Password: admin

## Customizing Usernames and Passwords

To change the default usernames and passwords for GLPI and OCS Inventory, follow these steps:

1. Open the secrets.env file in a text editor.
2. Modify the following environment variables according to your requirements:
    - For GLPI:
        - glpi_database_name
        - glpi_database_user
        - glpi_database_password
    - For OCS Inventory:
        - OCS_DB_NAME
        - OCS_DB_USER
        - OCS_DB_PASS
        - OCS_DB_SERVER
3. Save the changes and close the text editor.
4. Re-run the setup.sh script to apply the changes:
    ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

## Stopping and Removing the Containers

To stop and remove the containers, use the following Docker Compose command:

```bash
    docker-compose down -v
```

## Data Volumes

In the `docker-compose.yml` file, we have defined several data volumes for the MySQL, GLPI, and OCS services. These volumes are essential for persisting data across container restarts and ensuring that your data is not lost when updating or removing containers. Below is a brief explanation of the purpose of each volume:

- `sqldata`: This volume stores MySQL database files, ensuring that your database data is preserved across container restarts and updates.
- `glpidata`: This volume stores GLPI files, including uploaded documents and configuration settings, allowing you to maintain your GLPI instance's state even when the container is updated or restarted.
- `perlcomdata`: This volume stores OCS Inventory Server configuration files, which are essential for preserving custom configuration settings across container restarts and updates.
- `extensionsdata`: This volume stores OCS Inventory Reports extensions, allowing you to maintain custom extensions when updating or restarting the container.
- `varlibdata`: This volume stores OCS Inventory Reports data files, ensuring that your OCS reports are preserved across container restarts and updates.
- `httpdconfdata`: This volume stores Apache HTTPD configuration files for the OCS Inventory Server, allowing you to maintain your custom configuration settings when updating or restarting the container.

Using these data volumes ensures that your services' data and configuration settings are preserved across container restarts and updates, providing a more robust and reliable deployment.
